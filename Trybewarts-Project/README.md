##### This project was carried out after almost two months of classes at trybe (HTML, CSS & JS) - 04/03/2022

##### The purpose of this project was to create an application form for the 'Trybewarts' school, but to do this we would have to work as a team on the same branch, making us train our soft skills as well as our hardskills. In this project we used bulma library for css.

#### The images used in this project belong to Trybe, and cannot be reused.

##### Fell free to improve this project with more functions or style!!

##### If you use this project to your own benefits, please refer us!
##### Lets Grow Together!!!
