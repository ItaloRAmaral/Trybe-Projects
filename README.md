##### This repository will contain all the projects developed throughout the trybe full stack web development course! I started the course on 01/01/2022, so I still have a lot to improve and the projects are published here to show my improvement and learning during this one year course

##### Feel free to check and also to contribute to the improvement of the projects.

##### In each folder there will be a README containing what was needed to be done in each project.

####  -> List of Projects to show my improvement.
