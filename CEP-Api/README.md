### -> What is this project?
#### This mini project was intended to practice requesting information from an API and showing it in HTML. In this project VIACEP API was used.

### -> How it works?
#### We only need to inform the zip code (BR only) in the "CEP" field, and then click on search and the address, city and state will appear below.

### -> Illustrative images of how it works.

###### 1. Below is an example of how it works when you write a valid zip code
